This is really good! One small note: for your expression histogram, it looks like you're plotting H3K27me3 presence rather than gene expression, and you're choosing your cutoff based on that. You should be plotting a histogram of gene expression (i.e. column 4 in your data frame), not H3K27me3 presence, and choosing your cutoff based on that (-0.25)

3.75/4
