Nice, elegant solution. The use of functions really improves the readability.

Same comment as before about the extra empty lines in the output--how could you avoid printing them?

Brendon: Fixed the extra lines that were outputting for n_nearest_genes.py. I Had an extra \n and an extra print statement that account for the two blank lines between each output. Now it outputs with no blank lines.
